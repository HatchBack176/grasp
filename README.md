GRASP
================

GRASP (GRAphical liSP) is a graphical IDE for Lisp languages. Rather than merely visualizing Lisp syntax trees, GRASP treats the code and the graph as two interchangeable representations of the same underlying algorithm. While currently under development, a demo of GRASP is available at http://joeltg.github.io/grasp.
